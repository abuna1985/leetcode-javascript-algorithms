# Leetcode Javascript Algorithms

## Motivation

After much stalling, I have decided to start following the advice of a lot of senior developers that I really respect. I am going to start learning and completing algorithms on [leetocode.com](https://leetcode.com/). Now the part that bothers me when I research algorithm solution repos on GitHub are all I get are the answer. I get no background of why the developer solved it this way. I am coming with the reverse Paretto principle (20% is my CS knowledge and 80% is from Google). My goal for this repo is to document my learning/thought process and get comfortable solving intermediate/advanced algorithms with 80% of my CS knowledge and 20% Google. 

## Content

So each folder will have:
  * A JavaScript file with my solution and comments that tries to explain my solution like a normal human being.
  * A test suite with edge cases and testing the provided solution.
  * A `README.md` that walks through my whole thought process.Any additional links that I used as references will be provided here.

## Strategy
  
I will using brute force with the example inputs and outputs. My goal is to get an accepted solution. If I am not able to complete this after 15-20 minutes, I will find a solution. I will copy the first line of the solution and attempt a solution from there.

## Solutions

### Easy

1. [Two Sum](./easy/1-two-sum/)
2. [Palindrome Number](./easy/2-palindrome-number/)
3. [Contains Duplicate](./easy/3-contains-duplicate/)
4. [Roman to Integer](./easy/4-roman-to-integer/)
5. [Valid Parentheses](./easy/5-valid-parentheses/)
6. [Fizz Buzz](./easy/5-valid-parentheses/)
