# Leetcode Javascript Algorithms

## Motivation

After much stalling, I have decided to start following the advice of a lot of senior developers that I really respect. I am going to start learning and completing algorithms on [leetocode.com](https://leetcode.com/). Now the part that bothers me when I research algorithm solution repos on GitHub are all I get are the answer. I get no background of why the developer solved it this way. I am coming with the reverse Paretto principle (20% is my CS knowledge and 80% is from Google). My goal for this repo is to document my learning/thought process and get comfortable solving intermediate/advanced algorithms with 80% of my CS knowledge and 20% Google. 

## Content

So each folder will have:
  * A JavaScript file with my solution and comments that tries to explain my solution like a normal human being.
  * A `README.md` that walks through my whole thought process. Most of my easy solutions are going to involve a lot of looking at other peoples code (links will be provided). 

## Strategy
  
  My gameplan is use brute force with the example inputs and outputs. After enough punches to the face, I'll start asking Google and experimenting with other peoples solutions. My goal at this point is to explain the solution like I didn't just read the top search result verbatim.
